# leetcode-3000-dsa-challenge
Long-term challenge to solve 3000+ LeetCode problems with optimized, categorized DSA solutions and explanations.

🧠 3000+ LeetCode DSA Challenge

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms Mastery Repository, where I’m documenting my long-term journey to solve 3000+ LeetCode problems.
This repository is structured topic-wise, with clean, optimized code, explanations, and time/space complexities for every solution.

I update this repository regularly as I work toward long-term mastery of DSA for FAANG and top MNC interviews.

🚀 Goals

Solve 3000+ LeetCode DSA problems

Build deep pattern recognition & optimization skills

Strengthen fundamentals for system design & large-scale engineering

Practice consistency and disciplined problem solving

Prepare for FAANG, product-based, and high-bar interview processes
